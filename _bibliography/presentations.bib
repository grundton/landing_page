 @misc{Grund_von_Coler_2022_presentation, address={Vienna, Austria}, title={Continuous State Modeling for Statistical Spectral Synthesis}, abstractNote={Continuous State Markovian Spectral Modeling is a novel approach for parametric synthesis of spectral modeling parameters, based on the sines plus noise paradigm. The method aims specifically at capturing shimmer and jitter - micro-fluctuations in the partials’ frequency and amplitude trajectories, which are essential for the timbre of musical instruments. It allows for parametric control over the timbral qualities, while removing the need for the more computationally expensive and restrictive process of the discrete state space modeling method. A qualitative comparison between an original violin sound and a re-synthesis shows the ability of the algorithm to reproduce the micro-fluctuations, considering their stochastic and spectral properties.}, author={Grund, Tim-Tarek and von Coler, Henrik}, year={2022}, language={en} }

This paper presents Cloud Hands, a touchless musical assemblage that controls sample-based granular synthesis via hand motion. The paper discusses how the assemblage manifests in three emanations: as a sound interface, a digital music instrument and an interactive multimedia composition. A dedicated Python script extracts the hand landmark positions and distances from a camera frame, which are mapped to control parameters of granular synthesis of a sample in Pure Data. A Wekinator patch may extract symbolic hand poses to change samples and playback speed. The emanations use varying modes of visual feedback, from no feedback at all to wire-frame models of the hand to sound material-related segmentation of video material as a reference map. Performance recollections from the first author and other users of Cloud Hands are analyzed in order to identify conveniences and constraints of the sensing technology, mapping, and sound production. Finally, the paper discusses the influence of conveniences and constraints on aesthetics, form and performance behavior.}, journal={Proceedings of the 22nd Sound and Music Computing Conference (SMC2025), Graz, July 2025}, publisher={Institute of Electronic Music and Acoustics, University of Music and Performing Arts Graz}, author={GRUND, Tim-Tarek and HOFMANN, Alex}, year={2025}, month=july, pages={108–114}, language={eng} }
