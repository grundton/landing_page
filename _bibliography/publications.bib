 abstract = {Roles in the context of live-electronic music performance are often overlapping. We used a cross-cultural collaboration between a Vietnamese live-electronic composer-performer and a German instrument maker to study the development of roles. We followed the approach of building a digital music instrument inspired by existing acoustic instruments and conducted a case study with the task of developing a granular effect sample player, the Grain Bau, inspired by the Vietnamese monochord zither đàn Bầu. We analyzed the milestones, tasks and remote collaboration strategies and assessed the depth of participation. We found that in-person collaborative work tended to dissolve role definitions, while remote working emphasised them. We examine our strategies for remote working and discuss the influence of gender on our role development.},

title={Continuous State Modeling for Statistical Spectral Synthesis}, 
abstractNote={Continuous State Markovian Spectral Modeling is a novel approach for parametric synthesis of spectral modeling parameters, based on the sines plus noise paradigm. The method aims specifically at capturing shimmer and jitter - micro-fluctuations in the partials’ frequency and amplitude trajectories, which are essential for the timbre of musical instruments. It allows for parametric control over the timbral qualities, while removing the need for the more computationally expensive and restrictive process of the discrete state space modeling method. A qualitative comparison between an original violin sound and a re-synthesis shows the ability of the algorithm to reproduce the micro-fluctuations, considering their stochastic and spectral properties.},

title={CLOUD HANDS: THREE EMANATIONS OF A TOUCHLESS MUSICAL ASSEMBLAGE}, 
ISBN={9783200106420}, 
url={https://zenodo.org/records/15840925}, 
DOI={10.5281/zenodo.15840925}, 
abstractNote={Touchless control of human-computer interfaces in science-fiction has inspired several musical applications. This paper presents Cloud Hands, a touchless musical assemblage that controls sample-based granular synthesis via hand motion. The paper discusses how the assemblage manifests in three emanations: as a sound interface, a digital music instrument and an interactive multimedia composition. A dedicated Python script extracts the hand landmark positions and distances from a camera frame, which are mapped to control parameters of granular synthesis of a sample in Pure Data. A Wekinator patch may extract symbolic hand poses to change samples and playback speed. The emanations use varying modes of visual feedback, from no feedback at all to wire-frame models of the hand to sound material-related segmentation of video material as a reference map. Performance recollections from the first author and other users of Cloud Hands are analyzed in order to identify conveniences and constraints of the sensing technology, mapping, and sound production. Finally, the paper discusses the influence of conveniences and constraints on aesthetics, form and performance behavior.},
